# Development workflow — agent reference

Build, test, install, and hand-off procedure shared by all features. Paths use
the placeholders defined in `AGENTS.md` (`<repository-root>`,
`<krita-dev-root>`, `<toolchain-root>`).

## Before editing

1. Confirm the branch is `krita-sol`. Never commit custom work to `krita/6.0`.
2. Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/agent/codebase-map.md`, and the complete agent
   document of every feature you will touch.
3. Check `git status`. The tree may be dirty; existing changes belong to the
   user.
4. Identify the CMake target(s) that own each file you will modify
   (`kis_add_library(<target> ...)` in the nearest `CMakeLists.txt`).

## Shell notes (Windows)

Agents may run commands from PowerShell, `cmd.exe`, or Git Bash (MSYS). The
command examples in these documents are written for `cmd.exe`/PowerShell.
When the agent's shell is Git Bash:

- Prefix `cmd.exe` invocations with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`. With MSYS path
  conversion enabled, `/d /s /c` are rewritten as paths and `cmd.exe` opens an
  interactive prompt instead of running the command. The prefix is harmless
  when conversion is already disabled.
  ```bash
  MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 cmd.exe /d /s /c "call <krita-dev-root>\env.bat && cmake --build <krita-dev-root>\_build --target <target> -j 2"
  ```
- Pass Windows-style paths (`C:/Users/...` or `C:\Users\...`) to native Windows
  programs (`git -C`, `cmake`, `ctest`, `clang-format`). MSYS paths such as
  `/c/Users/...` work only for bash builtins and MSYS tools, and fail for native
  programs when path conversion is disabled (as in Hermes Agent).
- Put scratch files that native tools must read under the agent's scratch
  directory (`$TMPDIR`), not bare `/tmp`.
- Check for a running Krita before installing with
  `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq solstice.exe"` (and `krita.exe` for older launchers) (Git Bash) or
  `Get-Process krita` (PowerShell).

## Build

All commands run inside the environment script:

```bat
cmd.exe /d /s /c "call <krita-dev-root>\env.bat && cmake --build <krita-dev-root>\_build --target <target> -j 2"
```

Common targets:

| Source area | Target |
| --- | --- |
| `libs/ui` | `kritaui` |
| `libs/widgets` / `libs/widgetutils` | `kritawidgets` / `kritawidgetutils` |
| `libs/image` | `kritaimage` |
| `krita/` (executable, actions, data) | `krita` |
| `plugins/dockers/<x>` | `krita<x>docker` (check its `CMakeLists.txt`) |
| `plugins/tools/tool_transform2` | `kritatooltransform` |
| `plugins/dockers/layerdocker` | `kritalayerdocker` |
| `plugins/visionml` | `kritavisionml` |

A new subdirectory or new source file requires CMake to reconfigure; building a
target normally triggers that automatically. Building a low library (e.g.
`kritaimage`) rebuilds many dependents — expect long builds.

## Test

- Unit tests are declared with `kis_add_tests(Foo.cpp LINK_LIBRARIES <libs> kritatestsdk)`
  inside a `tests/` directory added via `if(BUILD_TESTING) add_subdirectory(tests) endif()`.
- Test names follow the source path, e.g.
  `plugins-dockers-quickaccess-QuickAccessCoreTest`.
- Run:
  ```bat
  cmd.exe /d /s /c "call <krita-dev-root>\env.bat && ctest --test-dir <krita-dev-root>\_build -R <test-name-regex> --output-on-failure"
  ```
  or run the test executable in `<krita-dev-root>\_build\bin\` with a single
  test function name.
- Add tests for parsing, persistence, serialization, legacy import, and pure
  layout logic. Interactive behavior (focus, shortcuts, tablet input, canvas
  rendering) still requires manual checks.

## Install

Install every target you rebuilt, from its build directory:

```bat
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LOCAL_ONLY=1 -P <krita-dev-root>\_build\<path-to-source-dir>\cmake_install.cmake
```

Examples: `libs\ui`, `libs\widgets`, `krita`, `plugins\dockers\restnote`.

- `.action`, `.xmlgui`, and data files are installed by the directory that
  declares them (`krita/` for `krita.action`, `kritamenu.action`,
  `krita5.xmlgui`).
- Windows locks loaded DLLs. If installation fails because Krita is running,
  ask the user to close Krita. Never terminate Krita yourself.
- After installing, Krita must be fully restarted.

## Hand-off checklist

1. Formatted with `<toolchain-root>\bin\clang-format.exe` (changed lines only
   for upstream files — see `docs/agent/coding-rules.md`).
2. `git diff --check` is clean for touched files.
3. All affected targets built; relevant tests pass (report failures verbatim).
4. All affected targets installed.
5. User document `docs/<feature>.md` and agent document
   `docs/agent/<feature>.md` updated in the same change; README link valid;
   `AGENTS.md` index updated for new features.
6. Listed the feature's manual regression checks for the user to run, and
   stated which ones could not be verified by an agent.

## Upstream synchronization

- `krita/6.0` tracks upstream Krita 6 only. Merge it into `krita-sol`; do not
  cherry-pick custom work onto it.
- Minimize edits to upstream files so merges stay clean: prefer new files,
  plugins, and small hook points (one member + one call) over rewriting
  upstream functions.
- The list of custom touch points in upstream files is maintained in
  `docs/agent/feature-inventory.md`. Check it when resolving merge conflicts.
- To see the complete custom diff:
  ```bash
  git diff --stat $(git merge-base krita-sol krita/6.0) krita-sol
  ```
